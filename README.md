# ABC-metadata-project

### Welcome  
In the ABC metadata project, a metadata model with mappings to international standards and a translation to JSON is developed.   

The ABC metadata model (Amsterdam UMC Biomedical Concise metadata model) is a **model** that provides guidance for **minimal** metadata implementation in the field of **biomedicine**. Being a **model** implies that it isn’t a ready-made solution, but it offers guidance to what metadata is needed for FAIR data management. It is deliberately kept **minimal**, thus facilitating data exchange between persons and systems, reducing workload for researchers and support alike. It could be considered to be a checklist at the utmost minimum of items that should be reported for FAIR data management. It aims to bridge the gap between generic metadata standards and detailed metadata generated by man and machine in the field of **biomedicine**, covering all disciplines in health and life sciences.  

The ambition of the development team is that the ABC metadata model eventually will grow to become a standard by wide adaptation in FAIR RDM practice, collective collaboration in improvement of the model and community endorsement.  

### Metadata standards and a JSON translation for YoDa  
The ABC metadata model is mapped to the international standards DataCite, Dublin Core and DCAT for maximum interoperability. The JSON translation of the ABC metadata model provides an implementation to use in YoDa. Using a script in Python, one can transform the Excel version of the ABC metadata model into a valid JSON file. All that’s needed to run the script is the location to the Excel file and the desired output location. Full documentation for this application can be found here [WORK IN PROGRESS].  

### Version  
The current version of the ABC metadata model is 1.0, released in March 2023. The first version of the JSON translation will be published in 2023.
